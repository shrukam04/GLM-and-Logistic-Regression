# GLM-and-Logistic-Regression
In this assignment, we will use the College dataset from the ISLR library to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a university is private or public. We will use the glm() function in R to fit a Logistic Regression model to perform classification in order to consolidate our theoretical knowledge into technique and skills with practical and applicational value. We will consolidate this by doing the below eight steps.   #### First, let us create the environment by importing the required packages to analyze and create a visualization on the dataset.
